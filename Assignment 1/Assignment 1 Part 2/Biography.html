			<p style="font-size:20px;">My name is Andrew Fang, I was born here at Ottawa. I personally like designing and<br> 
			art so as a child to now I would like to creativly design small things from origami to perhaps furniture.<br> 
			When I was in elementry school I played the paino but I wasn't any good at it and stopped playing it near <br> 
			the end of elementry school. During middle school I had an interest for robotics and join the lego robotics <br> 
			team to learn basic programming an how to build simply robot. It was an interesting experience to have. Later<br> 
			in highschool I started to focus more on the arts and sciences, I took all the main sciences and took visual arts.<br>  
			But this does not mean I did great in the sciences I wasnt the best but it alway intertesting to learn about.<br> 
			During highschool I also joined the track team and did 100m run I wasn't the best but it was a great time. I also <br> 
			have a interest in traveling and would travel to different country during the summer.</p>
